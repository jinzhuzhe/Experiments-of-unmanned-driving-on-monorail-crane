On-site experiments of unmanned driving on monorail crane
This is a real vehicle test we conducted while researching unmanned driving of monorail cranes. The experiment shows that our developed monorail crane unmanned driving system can achieve autonomous collision avoidance and safely cross slopes and curves.
The experiment was conducted by Zhang Xin, Zhang Yidong, Yang Chunyu, Yan Wanzi and others. If any use is found, copyright liability will be pursued.
